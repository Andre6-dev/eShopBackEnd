The next project is an Ecommerce demo using Spring Security, Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Thymeleaf and MySQL as a Database.
**All commits specify each of the implemented features**. You can then review each of these to find a feature of interest to you.


## Appendix

You can use Bootstrap 5 because I won't provide assets information.
